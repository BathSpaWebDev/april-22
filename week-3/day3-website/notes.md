### The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

### The Geometrizer
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".


### The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."


# Loops

## Challenge 1
Create an array of colours.

Loop throught the aray of colours using a for loop ( see the example from array.html to remind yourself ), and for each colour add a paragraph to your page that says: "Colour XX is YY".

So it will be

Colour 1 is Red
Colour 2 is Blue

etc...

You can choose the colours you want of course.

## Challenge 2
Create an array of numbers called numbersArray.

Create a function that doubles the number you put in ( hint: you can yuse the one we did today ).

Now create a for loop that loops through the array of numbers (don't do this bit inside the function), and in the curly brackets of the for loop call the function on the current number. 

## Challenge 3
Create an array of users. This time it will be an array of objects

eg. 
```
const users = [
    {name: 'Mark', email: 'msmith@gmail.com'},
    {name: 'Laura', email: 'lsmith@hotmail.com'}
]
```

Loop throught the aray of users using a for loop ( see the example from array.html to remind yourself ), and for each user add a paragraph that says: " My name is X" The idea is to replace X with the name property (   users[i].name   )
