# Portfolio

Companion to your CV to prove that you know the technologies on your CV.

## Design process

Wireframe:
- look for inspiration
    - doesn't have to be developer websites
    - designers, artists - anyone who has a collection of work to showcase
    - mix and match (steal/adapt from multiple sources)
    - time limit on this
    - and don't overthink it
- pick bits of other websites and add it to your wireframe
- until you have a complete website (wireframe)

###### Timebox: to time-limit an activity that could otherwise take as much time as you're willing to give it

## Requirements

- You need to start by describing you
- Portfolio: a list of projects
- Contact details

- You need to start by describing you
    - In general, if you haven't picked a specific industry to work in
      (you probably shouldn't pick one at this point), err on the side of being
      a bit more relaxed.
    - Your name, and "Web Developer" (or Frontend Developer)
    - Some things to potentially include:
        - Describe your ambitions
        - Talk about why you want to be/are a web developer
        - Talk about your background
        - Talk about your favourite things in tech
        - Talk about your hobbies or accomplishments outside of tech
        - List your values
            - This will help companies find the right team for you.
- Portfolio: a list of projects
    - A screenshot/picture
    - A link to the code (github repo)
    - (optional) A link to a codepen (do this only as a stretch goal)
    - A description
        - what the project is
        - what you did on it
        - some of the technologies/skills that it used
            - "Time Management Dashboard"
            - This was my first project using Tailwind CSS framework, and it
              involved a lot
              layout skills such as flexbox and grid. It is completely responsive,
              and built to designs provided by frontendmentor.io
              Best moment: Refactoring mobile-first design to desktop size
              Worst moment: Refactoring mobile-first design to desktop size
- Contact details
    - email address
    - phone number optional
    - LinkedIn
    - github/codepen

## Portfolio projects - which projects to add?

Do they have to be complete? No.

Do they have to be your best code? No.

For incomplete code, I recommend describing things you learned from it or would change:

"This was one of my earlier projects, with my experience since then I would make these changes: ..."

## Building

Technologies:

- vanilla HTML/CSS (which is fine!) or frameworks
    - Tailwind
    - stylistic frameworks (e.g. nes.css/papercss/other) (probably not)
        - only use it if you have a simple design, and you want to leverage
          the consistency and style of these frameworks
- interactivity? JavaScript/animations/transitions
- we will talk about putting this on github

## Iteration

Step 1:

A website with these elements:

- About me
- Projects
- Contact me

Step 2:

- Mobile responsive

Step 3:
- Navbar

## After the wireframe

- make a public repository on github
    - add your wireframe
    - decide what technology you are starting with: are you using Tailwind?
- start coding:
    - make a branch
    - code the structure
    - commit and push at that point
    - I recommend building the desktop design, merging it with main (review it)
    - Then make a new branch off of main with the mobile design
    - Then make a new branch off of main for the navbar

- find assets (pictures, icons and fonts)


## Finding free images

Look for copyright-free, zero attribution, allowed to use for commercial and non-commercial use.

## Image formats

- JPEG/JPG - is an image with a solid background
- PNGs - is an image, CAN have transparent backgrounds
- SVGs - they are scalable vector graphics (like font, they can scale to be larger without being pixelated)
- PDF - good for printing
- .sketchpad file, is specifically in case you lose your saved files on sketchpad (i.e. if you didn't make an account and save them) - so you can edit them on sketchpad again.

If you're making a wireframe in sketch or a similar app, save it as a JPG.

# Developer Case Studies

## Who they are?

How people get into web / software development.

They knew (before their first job, after their bootcamp):

- HTML and CSS
- how to work with frontend frameworks (Bootstrap, and some React)
- JavaScript
- Backend languages: Node (JavaScript on the backend) and PHP
- Programming paradigm: Object Oriented Programming (I'll introduce this later in the course but it isn't relevant for F/E programming)
- Scrum (Agile) - methodology for project planning.

## What do you want?

To know where they came from and how they got into their first role.
- biggest challenge, how they resolved it

What is a day in the life?
- Are there deadlines?
- What kind of companies do they work for/what do they do
- What's the difference working for a small vs big company (as a dev)?

What was their first job?

# Backend v Frontend v Fullstack

- fullstack == backend + frontend
- backend: (in web development) parts of an application that aren't on a website
    - uses a coding language on the backend such as PHP/Node/C++/Java/Python etc
- frontend: all the parts of an application that ARE on the website
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Example, Uber: Frontend will mean the application that you click, and the backend will be the system that finds you a driver.

## Resources/tips/courses for learning about backend

I'll cover this in week 12, and distribute a list of materials and resources.
